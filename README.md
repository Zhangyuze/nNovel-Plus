nNovel Plus
===========

nNovel Plus is a simple e-book reader which can be run on TI-Nspire calculator(ndless 3.1 or higher required).The program is able to encode text file with Chinese characters(GBK only) and support all nspire series including clickpad model, touchpad model, CX and CM.

Remember the code style of the source is really bad. This project didn't get any update for almost two years and I am not willing to update in the future.

1. Create two folders on your calculator named `Fonts` and `nNovel` in the document folder.
2. Send `HZK16.nft.tns` together with other fonts you like to the `Fonts` folder. Remember always keep `HZK16.nft.tns` as it is the default font.
3. Send `nNovel.tns` to your calculator.
4. Send text files to `nNovel` folder. Make sure all texts are coded with GBK.
5. Run `nNovel.tns` on your calculator.

#### Notice
1. Always keep`HZK16.nft.tns` as it is the default font. If failed on opening your persional font, `HZK16` will be used instead.
2. Remember to select 'Remove bookmarks and other files and quit' before you want to delete any text files. Otherwize bookmarks and other temporary files may remain and you cannot delete them without PC.
